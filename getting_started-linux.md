## Installing Build Dependencies

```sh
sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi binutils-arm-none-eabi \
    libnewlib-arm-none-eabi libstdc++-arm-none-eabi-newlib \
    libstdc++-arm-none-eabi-dev \
    gdb cmake make
```

## Start CMAKE generation

Open a terminal into the `W7500x-Surf5` directory :

```sh
cmake -B build
```

Finally go into the `build` directory where the files are generated
and Run `make` to build everything.

### For debugging `make` output

```sh
make > build.txt 2>&1
```

This would fill the complete output of `make` along with errors
into the `build.txt` file inside the `build` directory.
